///////////// Notes

/*

  What do we want to track?
  1. Liquidity for a given router at current time and over last X time
    a. Filtered by asset + chain
  2. Transfer volume over last X time
    a. Filtered by asset
  3. Transfer attempt
  4. Successful transfers end to end
  5. Auction requests
  6. Responded auction bids
  7. Won auction bids
  8. Number of active transactions at a given time
  9. Claimable tx funds at a given time
  10. Expired transactions?
  11. Fees collected
  12. Gas paid
  13. Onchain tx attempt
  14. Onchain tx fail
